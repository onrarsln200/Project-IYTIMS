## 📖 About The Project

This repository contains the conceptual framework and ongoing research for the IYTIMS (Intelligent Wildfire Tactical Intervention and Management System) initiative. Our goal is to shift the paradigm of wildfire management from reactive response to proactive, technology-driven prevention.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The IYTIMS framework is built on a multi-layered, autonomous ecosystem:

1.  **The Sentinels (Perception Layer):** AI-powered reconnaissance drones for real-time risk assessment.
2.  **The Brain (Decision-Making Layer):** Edge-computed AI core for sensor fusion and threat analysis.
3.  **The Responders (Intervention Layer):** A rapid-response fleet deploying BORTEX fire suppressant capsules.
4.  **The Hive (Infrastructure Layer):** A self-sustaining network of solar-powered charging stations.
